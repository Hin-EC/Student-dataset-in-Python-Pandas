# Student-dataset-in-Python-Pandas

This project demonstrates how to **explore and manipulate a student dataset** using **Python and Pandas**. The goal is to showcase various **data handling techniques**, including summarizing data, inserting and renaming columns, filtering data based on conditions, and more.

The project consists of a **Jupyter Notebook** that provides step-by-step explanations and code examples.

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked on the following **data operations** using Pandas:

- **Exploring the dataset** (summary statistics & dataset information)
- **Generating dataset statistics** (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)
- **Inserting new columns** based on conditions
- **Renaming columns** for better readability
- **Copying and removing columns** to restructure data
- **Filtering data** based on specific conditions

## Steps Covered

### 1. **Exploring the Dataset**
- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Use `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to understand the dataset structure.

### 2. **Generating Statistical Summaries**
- Compute dataset statistics such as mean, median, and standard deviation using `.describe()`.

### 3. **Inserting Columns Based on Conditions**
- Create new columns using `apply()` and `lambda` functions to classify or modify existing data.

### 4. **Renaming, Copying, and Removing Columns**
- Use `.rename()` to rename columns for clarity.
- Copy columns to preserve original data before transformations.
- Drop unnecessary columns using `.drop()`.

### 5. **Filtering Data**
- Extract subsets of data based on conditions using `.loc[]`.
